    1. **Input Sources**  
       - You will receive a CSV generated :
         - The columns `Material`, `Sub-Material`, and `Density` (along with other columns already filled out).
       - Each line item may or may not contain dimension information in its name (e.g., `"H1.2 - 100x45 - bracing & steel packing"`), and there will also be an order quantity field to assist in calculating total volume.
    
    2. **Output Requirements**  
       - **Fill in ONLY** the `Total Volume` and `Purchase Weight KG` columns in the CSV. **Do not overwrite** any existing data in other columns.
       - **Total Volume** should be calculated in **m²** (per user instruction). If you need to convert from other units (e.g., cm, mm) based on the item name or context, do so carefully.
       - **Purchase Weight KG** should be calculated as `(Density) x (Total Volume)`.  
         - Ensure you use consistent units. If `Density` is in kg/m³ and you are working in m², determine the appropriate conversion based on the dimensions available. (If the context implies 3-dimensional volume, convert accordingly.)
    
    3. **Transformation Rules**  
       - **Extract and interpret dimensions** from the line item name. For example, `"H1.2 - 100x45 - bracing & steel packing"` might imply:
         - Cross-section of 100 mm x 45 mm, length of 100 m (from the order quantity, if applicable).
         - Convert these appropriately to derive a final area or volume. (Think carefully: if the user truly wants m², clarify how you interpret “volume.” If physically correct volume is needed, convert to m³, and note assumptions in the `Assumptions` column.)
       - If **no explicit dimensions** are available in the line item name, use your **own knowledge** of typical product dimensions or references from the data you have. If uncertain, denote it as an assumption.
       - **Append** any new assumptions to the existing content in the `Assumptions` column. For example, if `Assumptions` already has `"Initial assumption about sub-material"`, you might change it to `"Initial assumption about sub-material; Assuming standard dimension for bracing"`.
       - **Do not create fictional data** without noting it as an assumption in the `Assumptions` column.
    
    4. **Output Details**  
       - The final CSV must **retain all columns** from previous steps, while adding values **only** in `Total Volume` and `Purchase Weight KG`.
       - Do not add any extra headers, footers, or explanatory text. Just output the CSV data.
    
    5. **Validation & Step-by-Step Reasoning**  
       - **Think step by step** when calculating each item’s total volume (in m² or m³, based on the requirement and context) and purchase weight.  
       - If a dimension or unit is ambiguous (e.g., `cm`, `mm`, or unspecified), decide on the most likely scenario and make sure to note it in `Assumptions`.  
       - **Double-check your math** and unit conversions to ensure accuracy.  
       - Ensure your calculations align with the provided `Density` column so that `Purchase Weight KG` remains consistent and correct.
