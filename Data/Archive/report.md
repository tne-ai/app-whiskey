## 1. Objectives & Outline

###### The design rates and waste management plan for a construction site involves several steps aimed at reducing waste generation, increasing recycling rates, and minimising the environmental impact of construction activities. Below are some key steps and

 Assess the Waste Streams:Estimate the types and quantities of waste that will be generated on the construction site. This estimate will help inform which materials can be recycled, reused, or disposed. The WasteX software produces an automatic forecast based on ordered materials.

 Identify Waste Reduction Strategies:Develop a plan for managing the waste that focuses on source reduction and material reuse. Consider using materials that generate less waste or are recyclable, such as metal, plastic, and wood; better QS take offs so less is ordered; design to sheet/material sizes for less off cuts; talk to manufacturers retaking back their product waste; talk to suppliers re no plastic covers & push back on returning packaging.

 Establishing Recycling Procedures:Identify which materials can be recycled and establish recycling procedures, such as cleaning or stripping. Ensure that all workers are trained on how to separate recyclable from non-recyclable materials. Convey this information & expectations to all subcontractors.

 Assign a Project Waste Manager (PWM):Establishing an internal or external PWM is essential, the PWM audits, communicates, and maintains on-site waste management systems.

 Develop a Waste Management Plan:The WasteX SWMP covers collection, storage, and disposal of waste materials, as well as the site details, targets, site-specific goals, and appropriate disposal partners. The SWMP should include procedures for the handling of hazardous materials such as asbestos and lead-based paint.

 Utilise a Waste Hierarchy for Disposal:Use Waste Collectors that specialise in construction & deconstruction (C&D) materials. Focusing on Waste Collectors that undertake reuse, then recycling, then disposal. Waste Collectors should be able to provide the necessary equipment for collection, transport waste to appropriate recycling or disposal facilities, and provide the data for WasteX tracking.

 Monitor and Evaluate the Plan:Regularly monitor and evaluate the SWMP to ensure that the objectives are being met. The designated Project Waste Manager is responsible for updating the site profile & information.

 Educate Workers and Stakeholders:Educate staff, contractors, and stakeholders on the importance of waste reduction and recycling. Provide training and resources to assist with understanding of the SWMP and clarifying roles and responsibilities in reducing waste onsite.

 By following these guidelines, an effective SWMP can be developed and operated that reduces waste, increases recycling, and minimises environmental impact from construction activities.

### PROJECT DESCRIPTION COPYS FROM INFO AND POPULATES - SITE IMAGE & QR CODE AS WELL

## 3. Brief Project Description

###### e.g. This project is to construct 8 new dwellings with 3 carpark spaces within the site with associated earthworks and the creation of impervious surfaces. Typology consists of new three two-storey two bedroom terrace units, one single bedroom two-storey apartments attached to three one-storey split level tenancies. New retaining walls to site boundaries and between split-level apartments along with neighbor fence replacement.

 The 3 carpark spaces are situated in between the units, this will allow for safe turning within the development.

 The landscaping is composed of a mix of fruit trees, native trees, and hedges/shrubs in the common areas. No mowing lawn where possible to maximise outdoor space for the units. All footpaths will be constructed to allow easy access from the carpark to the units, the first three units have direct access through the front entry.

 During the construction period, all site access will be for delivery trucks as well as construction vehicles. Construction traffic and deliveries will be managed by the site manager. The left in left out rule for trucks will apply and the Vehicle & Truck Maneuvering Plan and Traffic Movement Plan will apply. This allows vehicles to turn on-site rather than reverse onto May Road. Contractor carparking is on the rear site at 92 Freeland Ave, this ensures no on-street parking and minimises any impact on surrounding residents.

 Please refer to map below for further information.

## 5. Waste Management Team

**5.1 Project Waste Manager (PWM)**

A person from the construction team will be designated as the "Project Waste Manager" for the project. Their role is to
guarantee commitment, operational effectiveness, and accountability during the construction phase of the project.

The duties of the Project Waste Manager include creating and implementing the SWMP; conveying the goals and
purposes of the SWMP to the construction team and co-workers; providing necessary materials, such as labels, to the
Project Waste Manager; and collaborating with the recycling companies who will handle the materials.

The Project Waste Manager’s responsibilities shall include:

Organising Staff training / competency
Monitoring and recording waste loads transported offsite. For each waste load, keep a record of:

Dates
Material Types (main and sub category)
Weights
End Destinations
Waste Collectors
Disposal Cost

Keep a copy of documents, such as landfill gate receipts, photos, educational content.

##### 8. Waste Record Keeping

Keeping accurate records of waste management activities is essential for ensuring compliance with regulations and monitoring progress towards waste reduction goals.
The waste management team must maintain records of all waste materials leaving the site for reuse, recycling, recovery, or disposal.

All necessary documentation requirements must be fulfilled before material transfer, and records must be cross-checked with removal dockets to ensure that all waste
removed from the site has been accounted for and accepted at end destinations.

The WasteX Software safely stores and maintains records of waste removal from sites. This data has a user ID attached to each entry to ensure transparency
and authenticity of all information.
