0.13 tonnes (130 kg)/cubic metre
Uncompacted garden material		
Grass, leaves, foliage, branches, and other general bulky green waste. Does not include soil or logs, or mulched materials. Material is delivered loose and not from a collection service or otherwise compacted

Mixed general material—bulk, uncompacted		
Larger loads (more than 0.5 cubic metres) of any uncompacted waste
or
Material for diversion from residential, commercial, and industrial sources
Includes loads of construction and demolition waste of building products and materials that is dominated by packaging or light-weight insulation
0.20 tonnes (200 kg)/cubic metre
Compacted putrescible material

or
Material from refuse transfer stations in a compacted state
or
Waste or material for diversion that is similar in density to compacted waste, such as whole glass bottles and loose light-gauge scrap metal
0.32 tonnes (320 kg)/cubic metre
Mixed construction and demolition material		
Mixed loads of construction and demolition waste. Includes a mixture of timber, glass, metals, plastics, plasterboard, or fibre cement products, fibreglass or insulation materials, masonry, bricks and small (incidental) amounts of concrete, soil, or rock. If the load is predominantly concrete, soil, or rock, this should be categorised under “Soil, sludges, and similar excavated material” or “Concrete, rock, or other high-density materials”
Not applicable to loads of construction and demolition material that are dominated by lighter materials such as insulation, packaging, or plastics (“Mixed general material—bulk, uncompacted” applies)
1.20 tonnes (1,200 kg)/cubic metre
Soil, sludges, and similar excavated material		
Material predominantly made up of soil and excavated material including sand, silt, clay, and topsoil. May include stumps or logs and asphalt
Materials predominantly made up of slags, sludges (including biosolids), ash, foundry sand, pomace (fruit pulp), and abattoir waste
1.50 tonnes (1,500 kg)/cubic metre
Concrete, rock, or other high-density materials		
Waste or material composed of high-density materials and predominantly made up of concrete, rock, and rubble
2.00 tonnes (2,000 kg)/cubic metre
