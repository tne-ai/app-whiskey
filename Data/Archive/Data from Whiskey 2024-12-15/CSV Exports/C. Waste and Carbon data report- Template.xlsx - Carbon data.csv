,Notes:,,,,,,,,
,a),The contractors are required to complete the table above and submit it to the project manager at the completion of the project and copy to pcfcontracts@aucklandcouncil.govt.nz,,,,,,,
,b),"For reporting purposes Contractors are required to provide quantities (e.g. freight distance, weight of material disposed of etc). Lump sum cost items (i.e without quantities) will be rejected and the Contractor will be required to re-submit their report.",,,,,,,
,c),The grey shaded cells are to be completed by the Contractor and yellow shaded cells are to be completed by the Project Manager (AC).,,,,,,,
,d),Only the usage for the project purpose is to be reported. Fields that are not applicable can be left blank.,,,,,,,
,e),"The tonnes-kilometre (tkm), is calculated by multiplying the mass transported (in tonnes) by distance travelled (in km)",,,,,,,
,f),"Once completed, the project manager should email this report to pcfcontracts@aucklandcouncil.govt.nz.",,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
,Explanation of Calculation:,,,,,,,,
,"To calculate the total emissions for each entry, multiply the ""Usage / Quantity"" by the ""Emission Factor (kg CO2e/unit)"":",,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
,Total Emissions (kg CO2e) = Usage / Quantity * Emission Factor (kg CO2e/unit),,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
,For example:,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
,"If a petrol car travels 1000 km, with an emission factor of 0.2520 kg CO2e/km:",,,,,,,,
,Total Emissions = 1000 km * 0.2520 kg CO2e/km = 252 kg CO2e,,,,,,,,
,These emission factors are sourced from the Ministry for the Environment's 2023 guide for New Zealand​ (Ministry for the Environment)​​ (McHugh & Shaw)​.,,,,,,,,
