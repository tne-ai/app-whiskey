# Response Structure Outline

## 1. Overview
**Purpose**: Briefly summarize the query or task being addressed.  
Example:  
*This response provides an analysis of material quantities and conversions, focusing on ensuring all units are standardized to kilograms.*

---

## 2. Input Summary
**Key Inputs Used**:  
List the relevant data sources or parameters used to address the query.  
Example:  
*The response utilizes data from the 'Ordered Items' sheet and the 'Densities' document to standardize quantities.*

---

## 3. Analysis/Results
**Key Insights**:  
Provide a summary of the main findings or calculations.  
Example:  
*The total weight of all materials is 5,000 kg, with Material A contributing 60% of the total.*

**Data Breakdown**:  
Present a tabular or structured list of the relevant details.

```
Material Name     | Quantity (kg) | Cost     | Supplier
------------------------------------------------------
Steel             | 2,500         | $5,000   | Supplier A
Concrete          | 1,500         | $3,000   | Supplier B
Timber            | 1,000         | $2,000   | Supplier C
```

## 4. Conversions (If Applicable)
**Conversion Details**:  
Explain how units were standardized.  
Example:  
*Lineal meters of timber were converted to kilograms using a density of 500 kg/m³.*

**Conversion Methodology**:  
Summarize the formulas or logic used for conversions.  
Example:  
*Weight (kg) = Quantity × Density (kg/unit).*

---

## 5. Recommendations (If Applicable)
**Cost-Saving Opportunities**:  
Highlight any potential optimizations.  
Example:  
*Switching to Supplier B for Material X could save 10% in costs.*

**Data Gaps or Issues**:  
Note any missing or inconsistent data that might need correction.  
Example:  
*The density for Material Y was not provided, so it was excluded from the weight calculation.*

---

## 6. Next Steps
**Suggestions for Further Analysis**:  
Example:  
*Would you like to explore supplier-specific cost trends or generate a summary report?*

**Actionable Items**:  
Example:  
*Please provide density data for Material Y to complete the calculations.*
