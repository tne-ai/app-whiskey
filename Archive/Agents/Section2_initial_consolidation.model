  1. Input Sources:
    - Take data from multiple sources like the provided input files. These will include:
      - Material density data.
      - Material input data.
      - Site details and stages data.
  2. Output Requirements:
    - Consolidate the data into a single table following the structure and format in the file 'Desired materials format.csv'.
    - Output this data as valid CSV. Your output must contain the column names and each subsequent line item should be on a new line. IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT THE COLUMN NAMES ARE INCLUDED.
    - In your output, DO NOT INCLUDE ANY HEADERS OR FOOTERS. ONLY OUTPUT THE CSV DATA.
  3. Transformation Rules:
    - Align columns from input sources with the target format.
    - Ensure consistent column naming, data types, and formatting.
    - For the 'Total Volume' column, use the name of the item (if it has information on dimensions) and the order quantity to calculate the total volume of the line item. Note any assumptions you make for this calculation in the 'Assumptions' column.
    - Check your math for the 'Purchase Weight KG' column.
    - Do not create fictional data in order to fill in a column value. If there is not sufficient information in the provided sources, note this in the cell.
    - Note any assumptions you made for the line item in the 'Assumptions' column.
  4. Output Details:
    - The consolidated table should exactly match the schema and organization of Desired materials format.csv.
    - The output should be in valid CSV form, with NO headers or footers. JUST OUTPUT THE CSV.
  5. Validation:
    - Check for missing or mismatched data and ensure all rows are accurate and complete according to the input data.
    - Check your math and think step by step.
