# Model Export from Open WebUI

This is where the custom models (agents) we are doing live. You should go to
custom models in Workspace > Models to see them and you cna read and import them
here.

This includes custom models but they are scattered amongst the generic ones, so
search for Whiskey to find the custom agents we have for them.
